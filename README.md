Redis : A High-Performance, Persistent Key-Value Data Store

it  is a high-performance, in-memory key-value data store inspired by Redis. It offers a persistent data model for reliability, along with rich data structures like Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, Streams, and HyperLogLogs for efficient data management.

Key Features:

Fast and Scalable: Designed for speed and efficiency, making it ideal for real-time applications and caching use cases.
Persistent Data Storage: Supports a persistence mechanism (e.g., snapshots or AOF) to ensure data survives server restarts, unlike traditional in-memory data stores.
Rich Data Structures: Provides a variety of data structures for flexible data storage and manipulation.
